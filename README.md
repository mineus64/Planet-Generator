# Planet Generator

A Unity package for generating planets using Perlin Noise given a set of sample textures.

## Installation

Just import these items into your project, no muss no fuss.

## Prerequisites

None that I am aware of

## How to Use

This package comes with a set of pre-generated textures that you can just slap onto your planets and use to get going. Alternatively, you can slap the Planet Generator script onto one of your planets and set up the settings how you like. Feel free to feed in the planet seed from wherever.
